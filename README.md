# TypeChovy :dolphin:
TypeChovy is a typing game for the people who enjoy the look and feel of minimalistic things and it is my attempt to create a MonkeyType clone from scratch.
TypeChovy is my first big project that I used to create a full-stack application without a front end framework. Currently TypeChovy is built off of JavaScript ES6, HTML, and CSS for the front end; and Firebase as the backend handling all the accounts and user data.
TypeChovy is expected to include the following features:

- Create & signin to your own account.
- Up to 3 different languages.
- 3 unique typing modes: random, quote, time/words.
- Compete with other players online using the real-time scoreboard .
- Personalize your typing experience by changing the background, colour, and font of your dashboard.
- View your previous typing attempts for each mode.
